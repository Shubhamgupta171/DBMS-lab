# DBMS Lab SQL Assignment

This repository contains the SQL code and related files for the DBMS lab assignment of the MCA second semester.

## Introduction

In this assignment, we have implemented various SQL queries to manipulate data in a relational database. The assignment covers basic SQL commands such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, as well as more advanced concepts like JOINs, subqueries, and aggregate functions.

## Requirements

To run the SQL scripts in this assignment, you'll need:
- A relational database management system (RDBMS) such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc.
- SQL client or command-line interface to execute SQL commands.

## Files

- `queries.sql`: This file contains all the SQL queries implemented for the assignment.
- `schema.sql`: The schema file defines the structure of the database tables used in the assignment.
- `data.sql`: This file contains sample data to populate the database tables.
- `README.md` (this file): Provides an overview of the assignment and instructions for running the code.

## Instructions

1. **Setup Database**: First, create a new database and execute the `schema.sql` file to create the necessary tables.

2. **Insert Data**: If you haven't already, run the `data.sql` script to populate the tables with sample data.

3. **Execute Queries**: Open the `queries.sql` file and execute each query in your SQL client or command-line interface.

4. **Review Results**: After executing each query, review the output to ensure it matches the expected results as per the assignment requirements.
